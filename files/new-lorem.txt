The ideal number of content words on a webpage can vary based on several factors, including the purpose of the page, the target audience, and SEO considerations. However, here are some general guidelines:

Minimum Word Count: Aim for at least 300 words per page. This is often considered the minimum for SEO purposes to ensure search engines can index the content effectively.
Optimal Range: Many SEO experts suggest a range of 500 to 1,500 words for most pages. This allows for more in-depth coverage of topics, which can improve user engagement and search engine rankings.

The absolute minimum is 300 words. However, research has shown that long-form content (900 words or more) tends to rank better on search engines and will receive more social shares.

I see that the consensus is around 300 - 600 words as per Google’s guidelines, but I would recommend a different approach. Take a look at how much content websites that rank have. Since Google is tailoring its ranking approach to different niches learning from your competitors and improving on what they do would be the best approach. Once you have your pages and have some traffic coming in you can set up heatmaps (hotjar is a good tool that allows you to create up to 3 heatmaps for free) to see how visitors engage with your content and build on that.

This is not important. What's important is your message and the number of words per web page depend on that. Idly according to Google's recommendations you shouldn't have less than 400 words but my personal belief is having some content is always better than having no content. Continuously add quality content to your website without worrying about the number of words. Focus on the message.
